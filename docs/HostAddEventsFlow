There's a feature to Browse Shared Activity Options, or you can enter a new Option.
- Click "Browse Shared Events"
- There's an interstitial: "You have great ideas! If you agree to share your option ideas with
other hosts to use later, they'll share their ideas with you! Good deal, right? You'll still be
able to keep private information private. [x] it's OK to share my activities with other hosts.

Implementation: after the permission bit is set, new options are marked as `shareable`, and appear
in the shared list. Options created before the permission bit was set, are not `shareable`.

after the permission bit is set new Option form has
  - Checkbox next to each field `[x] This is private`.
  - Checkbox next to Location [_]This location is a private space (e.g. my home).
  - At the bottom of the form [_]This is a one-time event. Don't show it in the future.

New Options are created in the Options table.
Private fields are nulled before being served to a non-owner.
Any field can be overridden in the OptionPlan table - the instance of the Option. The form is
initially populated with the data from the Option, but will be stored in the OptionPlan
instance. So, when the Option description says "We'll see the 7pm showing of Black Panther",
a non-owner can edit that to "We'll see the 10pm showing...".

When browsing shared Options for a Plan, if a shared event is marked as a one-time event, and
the meeting time is outside the window of the current plan, don't show the event.
If a shared event is NOT marked as a one-time event, and the `Meeting Time` field is outisde
the window of the Plan, NULL out the `Meeting Time` field.

What if there's a URL field where you can enter the URL of an event you want to add? The server
scrapes the site at the URL for content. Maybe there's a list of sites we recommend you browse to
find events, and the scraper has a set of sites it knows how to scrape. If it's not one of those,
you have to enter your own copy/paste data. It still shows the original URL so guests can read it
there.
Maybe if it's an unknown site URL we present the user with a drop-down for every field, so they can
choose the appropriate content for each field from the scraped site. And we remember where we got
the HTML elements where we got the fields from, so the next time someone uses that site, we know how
to parse it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another Option
- Enter event details
- Checkbox next to Location [_] This location is a private space (e.g. my home).
- There's a checkbox at the bottom `[x] Save idea for future use (?)` <-- the help button says:
  If checked, your idea will be saved and can be reused by yourself or other groups. If your location
  is not a public space, the location will not be shared outside your friends.

A Browsing host sees their own ideas first, and can delete them (e.g. if they're out of date, like
"See Black Panther", or Pixies at Axis)
A browsing host can hit "Don't Show Me This Again" on events that have passed. Eventually they are
removed from display for all.
